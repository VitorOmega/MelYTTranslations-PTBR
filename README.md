# Guide to contributing
**Step 1:** Grab your favorite subtitling suite ([Subtitle Edit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit) and [Aegisub](https://aegisub.org/) are good options if you're someone just starting out but anything works!).

**Step 2:** Subtitle and translate any video(s) that you would like and export it (or them) as one of the accepted file types by YouTube, as listed in the link attached to the [Contributors Guidelines](#contributors-guidelines) section.

**Step 3:** Fork this repo.

**Step 4:** 
**If your language has not existed in the main repo yet:** Create a folder for your language in the `Subtitles/Translated` folder following this template: `ISO3166-1_Code - LanguageName (Country)`. Real world example: `ro_RO - Romanian (Romania)`. When creating the README for a new language, please copy [this template](Subtitles/Template/xx_XX%20-%20LanguageName%20%28Country%29/README.md) to your language and edit accordingly.<b>
**If your language exists:** Proceed to the next step.

**Step 5:** Add your translations to said folder. Although optional, it would be ideal to include a link to the translated video in the commit description. Tracking what has already been translated is easier this way for future improvements to the translations.

**Step 6:** Once you're done with translating a video, create a pull request on the main repo, adding a short description to the content that you wish to be sent to the main repo.

**Step 7:** Wait for it to be approved.

**Step 8:** PROFIT!!!

# Contributors Guidelines
This section serves the purpose to keep the subtitles quality to a certain standard.

Accepted formats: The encoding for both subtitle and titles and descriptions files should always be `UTF-8` to ensure no unreadable characters down the line.

Subtitles - all that YT supports (Refer to YouTube Help [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698 "here").)

------------


#### Rule 1: Neatly space sentences within the two line limit of YouTube's subtitle system.
The usual format goes as follows:
> First line: subtitle
>
> Second line: (On screen text)

It's best to space the context of the sentence accordingly to a new line/next track if it helps the sentence. This allows the views to see each line of text for nearly equal amount of time and have contexts in one line should viewers look away for a split second. There are not exact character limits due to the way subs are rendered on the YouTube Player ([Reference: Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/3peq4x/maximum_character_length_for_subtitles/ "Reference: Reddit")).

**Note: The "next line" here refers to the next track/clip in timeline.**
##### **✅Correct✅**
>So one of the fatal problems it has right now
>
>is battery related issues.

##### **❌Incorrect❌**
>So one of the fatal problems it has right now is battery related 
>
> issues.

------------

#### Rule 2: Only push when you're fully done with each video.
Because I would only do some minor checks and upload the file straight to YT. 

------------

#### Rule 3: While AI assisted translations are allowed, submissions should have human level correction for any flow, contextual and grammatical related issues. 

This will help keep the translations coherent and in a quality manner.

------------

#### Rule 4: Be respectful of other contributors.
It is encouraged for translators and subtitlers of the same language to come together and solve conflicts relating to the project(s) if they arise. Disagree with something? Point out the flaw(s) in a comment on the pull request or Issues ticket! (or even have a Discord group chat for that)

------------

#### Rule 5: Be coherent in the grammar and flow of the sentences.
When translating, translate the entire sentence and make sure that the final product interconnects for the best reading experience.

------------

#### Rule 5: Sound effects are occasionally missed out in some videos (due to time constraints during subbing of the original video), just translate accordingly whether there are SFX or not.

------------

#### Rule 6: No shameless promoting in the subtitles file, your name will be credited accordingly in the README of respective languages.

# We look forward to seeing your contributions!
