1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,310
Oh shit!

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,790
Kon-Melo!

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,810
Kon-Melo! Kon-Melo! Kon-Melo!

4
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:11,610
It's ya Tech Wizardess girl, MeloriTensei!

5
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:14,430
Hello, hello! Melori Valentine desu!

6
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,260
Right, Zenless Zone Zero.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,300
That's the main topic today.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,760
I hope today's livestream goes really well

9
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:25,280
because I'm so looking forward to this game, honestly.

10
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:28,030
Like, I'm genuinely so looking forward to this game.

11
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:29,760
I don't want to waste too much of your time,

12
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:33,140
but we're gonna get straight into the few important stuff.

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,760
Every session with MeloriTensei always starts with the few usuals.

14
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:41,110
One of which is graphic settings.

15
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:43,540
So, let's get right into it first.

16
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,480
Woo!

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,680
I pre-installed the game
the moment it was open for pre-installation.

18
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:50,630
It was…

19
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:55,430
I just went "Ope, let's go download them immediately, let's go!"

20
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:56,850
Right, without further ado,

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,980
let's get straight into setting up the graphic settings.

22
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:02,310
So at the moment, I have it on custom

23
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:06,380
and I have it on this following settings.

24
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:10,500
I'm not sure if this is really the setting that might work for me.

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,840
How about we try out max settings first,

26
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:16,910
then we'll figure out what happens next.

27
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:20,630
Well, I hope for the best for all I know.

28
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:22,310
Ooh, here we go.

29
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,950
TV: We interrupt your regular programming for this breaking news.

30
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,280
TV: A Companion Hollow has suddenly appeared
on Fortheenth Street.

31
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:28,540
TV: And has already breached level-three containment.

32
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,000
TV: The Hollow Investigative Association has dispatched a team
to the scene to carry out emergency protocols.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,900
TV: Evacuation of residents in nearby blocks is underway.

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,790
I wonder what's the breach.

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,180
TV: Please stay away from the Fourteenth Street area

36
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,090
TV: Residents of adjacent blocks are asked
to follow disaster guidelines
when evacuating in an orderly manner.

37
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:44,130
Aw, that Bangboo is adorable.

38
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,330
Also the AirPods though.

39
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,880
Belle: Wise - come check this out.

40
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:49,630
Wise: What's that?

41
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:55,310
Mel: Oh, this guy is the older brother.
Wise: Fourteenth Street? I think the news mentioned it earlier...
Give me a sec.

42
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,930
Mel: Alright.
Wise: Yeah, in the Janus Quarter.

43
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:00,200
Wise: They say it's already breached the level-three controls.

44
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,410
Mel: Gotcha.
Wise: We'll be seeing some business coming our way soon.

45
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:06,410
I wonder what they're really about, as in between the two of them.

46
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,680
I mean, what's their job?

47
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:09,550
I wonder.

48
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,340
At least that's getting me curious.

49
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,750
So we got choice of Wise and Belle.

50
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,780
I'm a girl, so I'm going for Belle.

51
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:18,500
Here we go.

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,780
Wee!

53
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:23,230
Belle: Cool, now we play the waiting game.

54
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,690
"Chapter 0: Business x Strangeness x Justness"

55
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:30,760
Huh.

56
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:32,030
Nicole: Go left!

57
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,410
Whoa, okay.

58
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,780
Wooo, okay.

59
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:37,260
My controller rumbled.

60
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,410
Okay, so there is rumble support, that's interesting.

61
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,590
Great job, HoYoverse, honestly.

62
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,930
Holy.

63
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,910
Nicole: Hm?

64
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,680
Mel: Hm?
Gangs: Over there!

65
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:48,760
Gangs: Go! go!

66
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,360
What the heck is…

67
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,210
oh.

68
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm just wondering what's with that thing.

69
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,710
That's so huge, not to mention the band-aid was like…

70
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:02,760
on that spot.

71
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,030
Alright.

72
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:12,060
Reporter: I'm *ing *ed! As this station's reporter,
I can't listen to this anymore! Those criminals need to get *ed!

73
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:16,960
"Those criminals need to be get screwed."

74
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:19,060
Oh my god.

75
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:27,610
Reporter: As soon as we find them we should just *ing * them all!
And then * them again!

76
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:29,940
I'm…

77
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,580
mmmm…

78
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,980
alright.

79
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:37,480
Billy: There's a window! Boss, we can get out this way!

80
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:41,280
I wonder if these guys are the ones that they're looking for.

81
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:49,190
Nicole: But that's a Hollow down there...
Fine, a way out is a way out. Can you break the glass, Billy?

82
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,610
Billy: Easy! Leave it to me!

83
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,940
Alright.

84
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:58,750
Ah...

85
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:03,500
Uh... (laugh)

86
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,000
Ah.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,340
Billy: Uhh...
(Mel laughs)

88
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,560
Tryna play cool, I guess. (laughs)

89
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:22,100
Anby: It bounced off. This glass must be tough.

90
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:22,960
Oh?

91
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:27,390
Nicole: Wait! Is that a flashbang?

92
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:34,350
Anby: Correct. It's a GS 2 high-lumen military flashbang.
The blast is quite strong.

93
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,800
Mel: Oh?
Nicole: Awesome! Time to wake up, Billy!

94
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,980
Oh, Billy, okay.

95
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:41,630
Alright.

96
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,980
Gang: What?!
Mel: (mocking) HUH?

97
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,100
Billy: Eyes open everyone!

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,350
Billy: SAY- CHEESE-!

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,640
(imitating flashbang) Biii!

100
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:58,430
Gangs: Wahhh! My eyes!

101
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:02,000
Gang leader: I'LL KILL YOU ALL!

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,610
Nicole: Hahaha, you've made a mistake, mister.
We aren't your enemy.

103
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:09,730
🥵👉👈 Yesh, mommy. 🥵👉👈

104
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:10,810
Ah, I mean, sorry.

105
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:12,640
(Screenshot sound)

106
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:14,310
Uh...

107
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:15,630
It's not what it sounds like.

108
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:18,260
I'm innocent, I swear.

109
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:23,180
Reporter: What? You've found the Red Fang *ers?

110
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:26,660
Oh my god, the reporter guy.

111
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,930
Reporter: Then what are you *ing waiting for, Commander?!

112
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:36,940
Reporter: Pick the biggest gun and rain down JUSTICE!!!

113
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:40,230
Helicopter: Falcon 4, attack order received.

114
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,800
Oh my god, come on.

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,610
You got three surrendees at least-

116
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,610
I mean, at least from what they see.

117
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,260
And they're told to attack… ugh...

118
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:54,130
okay.

119
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,260
WITH A ROCKET!

120
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:58,980
I mean, a missile!

121
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,580
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?!

122
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,080
Nicole: I'm done for...

123
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:06,160
Oh, not like this.

124
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:12,710
Look at Billy's face, he's genuinely giving that "Not Like This" face.
(NOT LIKE THIS, BOTTOM TEXT)

125
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:13,690
Ah!

126
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,440
Billy: I want to file a complaint!

127
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:26,130
(laugh)

128
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,230
I…um.

129
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:36,880
I don't know if you are in the right place
to file a complaint, but okay!

130
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:44,250
I wonder where's the box (a strongbox) that we saw earlier.

131
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,810
Oh.

132
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:53,180
Woo~!

133
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,180
But wasn't it night time out there?

134
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:57,500
We're landing in…

135
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,500
🥵👉👈 Yesh, mommy. 🥵👉👈

136
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,710
She's so cool.

137
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,130
Oh my god, that walk.

138
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,260
That walk.

139
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:07,430
She's so cool.

140
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,690
X (button).

141
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,050
Looks like attack, yeah. Oh!

142
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,380
I mean, with every game, the X (Xbox) is always attack,
so I'm not surprised.

143
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:19,810
"Basic attacks generate energy."

144
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:24,440
"With enough energy, Special Attacks will be enhanced to the…

145
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,000
EX special attacks."

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,140
I assume it's like exclusive or extreme?

147
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,610
Wow!

148
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:34,980
The game makes you press the button
instead of skipping through it.

149
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:36,580
Okay.

150
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,390
Alright, alright, alright.

151
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:49,350
Oh my god, the camera work. Holy.

152
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:58,690
Anby: Ahem, this is Anby Demara, a member of the odd-job agency, the "Cunning Hares". I accidentally fell into a Companion Hollow.

153
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:03,930
Oh, I assume we're currently in a different universe.

154
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:04,810
Because…

155
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:07,810
oh, that explains the difference between day and night.

156
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:09,640
Okay, I get it now.

157
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:13,660
Billy: -Ah, there you are, Anby! Great!

158
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:19,440
I mean, you have every right to be excited at this point, Billy.

159
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,050
Billy: I knew you'd be okay- (slash)

160
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,230
Billy: Whoa whoa! Hey, what's gotten into you?! You almost cut me!

161
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:31,130
Anby: I've met another being of reason.
He looks a lot like my colleague: Billy Kid.

162
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:33,330
(Mel laugh)

163
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,040
Billy: What are you talking about? It's me! Billy!

164
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,000
(Mel laugh)

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,930
Anby: An Investigator has previously encountered Ethereals
who can mimic human speech and behavior.

166
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:49,130
Anby: The Investigator rescued the Ethereal
pretending to be their teammate,
but once they got out of the Hollow, it revealed itself.

167
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:55,460
Billy: Wait, isn't that the plot of that movie
that was in theaters not long ago!?

168
00:08:55,466 --> 00:09:00,180
Anby: ...There was a long list of victims involved
in the incident. I read all their names.

169
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:02,730
Mel: Oh?
Billy: That's called a cast list!

170
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,130
(Mel laugh)

171
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,830
Wait, wait, that was not real?

172
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,280
Hold on, whaaa?

173
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:08,290
Hold on.

174
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,810
No, I'm getting confused right now.

175
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,100
Is… is...

176
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,830
is Anby a robot of some sort?

177
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,860
Because that's hilarious.

178
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:19,080
Anby: Question: Who would you most like to have dinner with?

179
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,130
Oh hey, security questions. (laughs)

180
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:25,780
At least that's what I would think if Anby thinks like a robot.

181
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:34,230
Billy: Huh? Dinner? Of course...
that'd be the big screen superheroes, the Starlight Knights!

182
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,110
Billy: Wait wait wait! Put your blade down, I'll tell you!

183
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:43,600
You know, with that kind of lore,
I actually am kind of interested in seeing if…

184
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,000
if HoYoverse might make it into like a proper anime.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,200
Billy: ...It's really the late night drama actress
from "Oh~ Sweetie", Monica...

186
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,030
Anby: All clear. The individual has been confirmed
as the real Billy Kid.

187
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:02,130
(laughs) Alright.

188
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,680
So his name… his full name is…

189
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:05,880
Billy Kid.

190
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:14,380
Anby: Meeting Billy Kid increases my chances of survival
by over 67.8%. I'm glad you're okay, Billy.

191
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:17,710
Billy: I told you I'm me!

192
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:25,140
Hehe. "I told you I'm the real deal." (laughs)

193
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:26,410
Aww.

194
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:32,230
Billy: ...It's been a while since we fell. Nicole must be trying
to come up with a way to get us out from the outside.

195
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:32,860
Hmm.

196
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:38,700
Billy: But will she be willing to pay for the help?
You know how Nicole is, hahaha...

197
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,790
I mean…

198
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,930
If Nicole is as what we think of her as…

199
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:51,950
Anby: Based on Nicole's tight-fisted spending habits,
I'd say your original analysis is likely correct.

200
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,630
So, she would be more likely to outsource
than to do the job herself.

201
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:57,710
Alright.

202
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:02,290
Billy: Damn... Now you've got me worried.

203
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:05,380
Alright, that might be a bit... yeah.

204
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,230
It makes it seem like she's hopeless.

205
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,480
I don't know.

206
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:11,700
Alright.

207
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,790
"Stunned enemies are unable to move
and sustain additional damage."

208
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:21,280
"Special Attacks trigger a Chain Attack
upon hitting a Stunned enemy."

209
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:23,110
Wait, what?

210
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,510
Oh, that.

211
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:29,810
So when we swap out…

212
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:31,760
Alright.

213
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:38,360
When your squad contains two or more agents,
press [RB] to switch between them.

214
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,200
"Launch a chain attack."

215
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,130
Uh… one…

216
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,350
two…

217
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:48,510
No wait, that…

218
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:50,880
Oh, that!

219
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,580
(Billy screams)

220
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,910
Oh, that's hella cool.

221
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,860
That's hella cool, I gotta admit.

222
00:11:57,866 --> 00:12:02,100
"When your characters hit enemies, they generate Decibels."

223
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,010
Alright.

224
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:07,930
"Once your Decibel rating is at Max…

225
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:13,010
Press [RT] to launch the Ultimate."

226
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,280
Alright.

227
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:17,980
"Wipeout."

228
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,350
I like the camera work.

229
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,960
Seriously, that's so different.

230
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:25,890
(Billy's gun clicks)

231
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,280
Ah.

232
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,630
Classic Billy moment.

233
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:33,260
Billy: Hmm?
(Mel laughs with her mouth full)

234
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,350
That sound he made.

235
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,750
Billy: Uh-oh, forgot to reload!

236
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,980
Billy: Okay buddy, wait a sec! Time out!
Mel: Hehe.

237
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:46,530
(Anby's sword slash)
Billy: Wahhh-!

238
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,130
(laughs) Oh my god.

239
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,630
Billy: Ughh!

240
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:05,310
Oh, that's big.

241
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,140
That's big.

242
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:17,710
"When a golden prompt appears,
press [swap] to trigger a Perfect Assist."

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,410
Ooh.

244
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:24,510
"Then press Basic Attack to launch an Assist Follow-Up."

245
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:26,230
Oh, like that.

246
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:29,630
So if you don't do it, it doesn't do it.

247
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:30,790
"Consumes assist points."

248
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,260
"Chain attack can replenish it."

249
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,200
Alright.

250
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:37,560
Wooh.

251
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,060
He was on guard.

252
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:43,200
Can we get behind him and then... give him a slap!

253
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,910
Oh, we can… we can ult it.

254
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,960
Let's go!

255
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:51,680
Billy: He's recovered?

256
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:53,660
Billy: Is his Ether activity still increasing?

257
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,250
Anby: Keep up the attack?

258
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,860
Billy: Nah! we don't have the firepower to fight for long!

259
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:04,180
Ooh, cool.

260
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:05,860
Smoke 'em.

261
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,010
Alright.

262
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:09,110
Let's go!

263
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,200
And of course they'll be gone.

264
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,510
eeeeYup.

265
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,610
I wonder where to they've gone to.

266
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:22,950
Ah, the box.

267
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,580
"Meanwhile, in downtown New Eridu."

268
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,660
"At a video store in the corner of Sixth street,

269
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,580
over in the Janus Quarter..."

270
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,830
Oh, Nicole!

271
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:38,100
Nicole: Hey, listen up! I was there when that explosion took place.

272
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,330
Wise: Hello Nicole... It'd be nice of you to knock next time.
(Mel laugh)

273
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,980
Come on, Wise!

274
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:53,640
Belle: I feel like I hear of your urgent needs
at least three times a month, Nicole...
(Mel giggles)

275
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:56,730
Damn it, Belle!

276
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,580
🥵👉👈 Yesh, mommy. 🥵👉👈

277
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:02,380
Alright, so I assume these proxies are…

278
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:05,360
had already made a name for themselves.

279
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:08,830
Wise & Belle: What trouble did you get yourself into this time?

280
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:11,410
So we're up to the task.

281
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,130
(In Chinese - Mandarin) "Don't Read Before Sleep"

282
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:17,640
"Don't read before bedtime."

283
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,730
Oh my god, I find that hilarious.

284
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:24,930
I assume that's a horror magazine or something.

285
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,850
It's Friday morning!

286
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,480
Today is Friday in California!

287
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,410
Sorry!

288
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Nicole: They're really cracking down on Proxies.
They set up a hotline, and...

289
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,200
Cracking down on proxies?

290
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,790
Wait, hold up.

291
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,680
So we're basically another White Hat vigilantes or something?

292
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:49,140
"Which creditor is chasing after you this time?"

293
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,750
I kinda wanna hear what the response is.

294
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,680
Belle: So what's the hurry, Nicole?
Which creditor is chasing you this time?

295
00:15:55,683 --> 00:16:01,850
Nicole: That's not it! I was set up by Public Security
and that angry reporter from Ridu TV!

296
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,080
Also I just realized, hold up, umm...

297
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:10,230
Looking respectfully, right beside my head, umm...

298
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:15,380
She has a mole on a unique spot.

299
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:18,140
Man, character designers honestly.

300
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,310
I mean, I get it, moles can be everywhere but…

301
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:29,630
I just realized about that. (laughs)

302
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:33,810
"Finish the job and I'll clear my entire bill in one go."

303
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:36,040
Wait, she owes us?

304
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:37,580
Hold up.

305
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,310
You know what, screw it.

306
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:39,780
"Sounds pretty good."

307
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:43,530
It would be hilarious if we haggled for a better offer.

308
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:45,950
How about be a part of us?

309
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,380
Hmm...?

310
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:54,980
Belle: You've been dodging your bill for months Nicole.
Have you even considered the interest?

311
00:16:54,983 --> 00:17:00,880
Nicole: Fine, I'll give yo ua share of the commission payment.
Does that cover it?

312
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:02,330
Oh my god...

313
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,260
i'm so...

314
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:08,400
Oh my god, I'm so harsh. (laughs)

315
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,040
I'm sorry, Nicole.

316
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,080
But I honestly like...

317
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,710
like... Belle's look.

318
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:16,380
Oh my god, her look is just...

319
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,160
Y'know what? Hold on. Lemme just...

320
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,680
(Screenshot sound)

321
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:22,580
Don't mind if I do. (laughs)

322
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:27,910
Nicole: Ohhh? Deploying your "Bangboo Double", huh? Okay!

323
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,610
Bangboo double.

324
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:34,410
Oh, because they're (the) "proxies", I think.

325
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,180
(gasp)

326
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:37,840
Oh my god.

327
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:41,540
That's so…

328
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,950
So adorable.

329
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,560
(stutters)

330
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,360
Oh my god, okay.

331
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,150
"Metro Goblin"... Goblin?

332
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,150
(Fubuki sings WE ARE JAPANESE GOBLIN)

333
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,430
Mel & Fubuki: "WE ARE JAPANESE GOBLIN"

334
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:53,290
(laughs)

335
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:55,260
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,980
Wise: Hello, can you hear me Nicole?
You can put Eous through now!

337
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:09,810
Nicole: Okay! Right, little one, off you go then~

338
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:13,900
Nicole: Done! Bangboo's on the way!

339
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:19,400
Wise: Well then, can we begin?

340
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,900
Belle: Uh-um.

341
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,230
Woah.

342
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,930
Hehe, what's that?

343
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,780
A bomb? A pokéball?

344
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,760
I wonder what that is. Honestly.

345
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:45,930
Anby: Incoming, get ready.

346
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:53,530
Billy: Wait, that wasn't me!

347
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,930
Proxy Bangboo: Hey, guys! Over here!

348
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:58,090
Huh.

349
00:18:58,099 --> 00:18:59,910
Proxy Bangboo: Good work, all.

350
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,480
Anby: It's a scarf-wearing, talking Bangboo...

351
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:05,010
Billy: Ohhh! You're-

352
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:07,200
Billy: Phaethon!

353
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,700
Oh my god, she's so cool when she leans like that.

354
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,930
"A few more compliments and I might give you a discount." (laughs)

355
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:17,750
Ahh, let's... Let's have a look.

356
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,110
Belle: A few more compliments like that
and I might just give you a discount.

357
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,110
Anby: Really?

358
00:19:22,116 --> 00:19:26,330
Billy: I think the Proxy was just trying to be polite, Anby.

359
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,010
Anby: We have to get out of here.

360
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:28,960
Alright.

361
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:34,700
Anby: Unless, Billy, you'd like to stay here forever?
That new Starlight Knight Belt you wanted?
I guess I'll place it at your grave next year.

362
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,930
Hehe... "I'll place it at your grave next year."

363
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:43,680
Billy: When you say things like that with that poker face of yours,
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

364
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:49,480
"Observation Data - Scattered throughout the Hollows,
you'll find crucial materials known as "Observation Data"

365
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:57,730
Each commissioned Hollow contains 3 sets of Observation Data.
Collecting these data sets increases the final rating of...

366
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:58,780
of?

367
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:04,460
your commission and rewards you with additional Polychromes.

368
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,980
Alright, I wonder what Polychromes are.

369
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:11,150
"Observation data in the hollow will be saved once picked up.

370
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,860
You don't need to pick it up again when exploring the same area."

371
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,330
Oh, so like, it's a one-time thing.

372
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,040
It's like a one-time bonus.

373
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,310
Right.

374
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,560
Poopie.

375
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,880
We're getting into…

376
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:27,590
Ooh?

377
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,280
A battle, I assume.

378
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:37,130
Oh my god, Anby close-up is so pretty.

379
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,340
Ooh.

380
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,900
Ooh, that is a good synergy.

381
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,660
I like this.

382
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:47,830
Ooh, whatever that is.

383
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,180
"Hollow observation data." Oh, okay, right.

384
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,340
What is this one?

385
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,290
Anby: Ethereals. They're catching up, Proxy.

386
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:56,900
Oh.

387
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,180
Billy: What should we do? Fight?

388
00:20:58,183 --> 00:20:59,700
Ooh.

389
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,180
Wise: It's cool. Just come with me.

390
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:03,650
Alright.

391
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,880
Does it do it by the time basis or step basis?

392
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:09,380
Oh, per step basis, gotcha.

393
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:12,380
Wise: This track-laying machine... We can use this.

394
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:14,480
Ooh, what's this?

395
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,200
Oh, it's just conveyor belts.

396
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:20,860
Wee! More boxes.

397
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:26,950
"Safety valve data. - The system log shows the valve is unlocked
by inserting the preset amount of Gear Coins..."

398
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,280
Really?

399
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:34,410
Why do we need to pay to get to be safe?

400
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,130
Well, I'ma...

401
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:40,510
Billy: Hmph! Even in a Hollow,
they're seriously gonna charge a toll?

402
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:44,150
Billy: Even if I agree, the Starlight Knights wouldn't agree!

403
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,450
Billy: And even if the Starlight Knights agreed,
Nicole wouldn't agree!

404
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,450
Billy: ...So take that! Starlight Mirage!

405
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:57,560
HDD Broadcast: Agent Billy detected,
he is forcing the valve lock with the butt of his gun.

406
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:03,310
HDD Broadcast: Valve detection - Open. But Agent Billy has suffered
partial damage to his hand's exoskeleton.

407
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:07,160
Partial damage? What kind of partial damage?

408
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,090
What did he do?

409
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:09,230
Billy: Ow... That hurts!

410
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:12,660
(laughs) What did he do?

411
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,980
We're escaping.

412
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:16,590
See ya!

413
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:19,680
We're bustin' outta here.

414
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:22,080
Hell yeah.

415
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,210
Oh?

416
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:32,340
Pop pop pop pop.

417
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:37,680
Get the heck outta here, Bill!

418
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,010
Wise: Don't worry. Just do what my sister says.

419
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:46,210
Billy: That voice... Oh! It's the other Phaethon!

420
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,700
"Don't take over my channel like that!"

421
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:55,040
Belle: Seriously, can you not jump on my channel
all of a sudden? You scared me.

422
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:56,880
"Sensory synchronization has been disconnected-"

423
00:22:56,883 --> 00:22:58,130
Okay.

424
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:59,510
Anby: It's gone quiet...

425
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:01,660
Billy: It became a regular Bangboo.

426
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:06,540
Ohhhhh. So this Bangboo can be…

427
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,980
Can be hacked in and be used as a proxy.

428
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:11,680
Billy: Why would they de-sync at a time like this?
(Mel breaks)

429
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,030
Anby: Going straight forward. Brace for impact.

430
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:15,030
Just smash the wall.

431
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:18,510
Billy: We're gonna crash! We're gonna crash! we're gonna crash!
(Mel laughs)

432
00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:21,430
"With a strange sense of release,
the two pass through the wall as though it's nothing.

433
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:26,150
Oh, so that's the fake Hollow wall that takes us back to the surface.

434
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,410
Anby: The oppressive weight of Ether is gone.

435
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:35,030
Billy: We're out... We're finally out! Aha!

436
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:37,950
Aw, that celebration outta Bill.

437
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,040
Ugh, fiiine.

438
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:45,280
"Nicole Demara."

439
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:46,910
"Partnership established."

440
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,330
Gotcha.

441
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:54,160
Alright, we now have reached the point of free movement.

442
00:23:54,166 --> 00:24:01,310
But regardless, I hope to be able to continue
making Zenless Zone Zero streams.
(This highlight was painstakingly clipped
around several stream crashes)

443
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:05,330
And there'll be more Blue Archive streams
and Zenless Zone Zero streams.
(Hopefully it's bearable, lemme know
in the comments if you like it!)

444
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,860
OtsuMelo deshita. (It's been ya girl, Mel)

445
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:09,090
Have a good night, y'all.

446
00:24:12,883 --> 00:24:18,930
