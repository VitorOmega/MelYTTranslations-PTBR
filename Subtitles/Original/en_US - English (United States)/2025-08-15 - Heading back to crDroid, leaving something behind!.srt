1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,330
Something's a little different today.

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:05,370
Kon-Melo, it's ya tech wizardess girl, MeloriTensei!

3
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:07,430
And today, something's a little different.

4
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:10,450
Something rolled into my mail.

5
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:12,080
I got a new pair of gloves!

6
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,080
Let's go!

7
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,350
Well, um…

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,000
Something feels a little off.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Something feels like…

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,380
Hmm…

11
00:00:23,383 --> 00:00:25,770
Something's a little off.

12
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:26,670
Like…

13
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,120
Hmm…

14
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:30,700
It's like I've kinda lost myself.

15
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,930
Somewhere in identity.

16
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:33,920
It's like…

17
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,000
What am I?

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,980
Am I really MeloriTensei?

19
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:40,170
Is this really me?

20
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:42,380
What am I?

21
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:45,600
Not just joking!

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,120
There's my actual one right here!

23
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,250
So...

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,070
I got this new pair of gloves,

25
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:54,500
initially with the intent to solve touch issues.

26
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,400
So I have to stop using this bloody thing.

27
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,370
But when it rolled into my mail,

28
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:01,830
I realized that this was a little extra tight.

29
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,170
It was too tight for me.

30
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,930
And it was really uncomfortable.

31
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,080
It was heavily for winter use.

32
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,580
And guess what?

33
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,480
It barely even cost a dollar.

34
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:13,000
It's like, what, 70 cents or something like that?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,400
So you would expect terrible quality out of that.

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,580
And yes, it does make me feel itchy.

37
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,520
I did wash it multiple times.

38
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:21,870
It ain't leaving.

39
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:22,730
It's terrible.

40
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,450
It's such a shit glove.

41
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,630
So I'm going to yeet this.

42
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:30,850
Oh my god, it's so hard to take it off.

43
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:33,950
Yeet!

44
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,200
Much better.

45
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,320
Anyways,

46
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:40,220
if you haven't read the title of this video today,

47
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,480
I'm going back to crDroid again.

48
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:44,980
Like, if you have seen all the past videos I've got,

49
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going like,

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,930
freaking PixelOS, crDroid, PixelOS, crDroid,

51
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,930
freaking hell, we're going back to crDroid again.

52
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:56,080
And this time, I want to do things a little bit different.

53
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,880
So, here, ask yourself,

54
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:00,950
would you really want to continue using

55
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,720
your current instance of Android

56
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:05,920
if it's lagging to living hell?

57
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:09,370
Here, I even got this guy back to demonstrate.

58
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,380
So let me just open up my phone.

59
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,630
You're paying attention, you're seeing this, right?

60
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,030
Right.

61
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:18,050
Watch.

62
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:30,000
Erghh…

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,470
*DankPods scream*

64
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,180
Oh, the sheer lag!

65
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:36,900
Like, loading the page is one thing,

66
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,130
because I've got very, very low reception of Wi-Fi.

67
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,780
This scrolling is another thing!

68
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:45,630
*more DankPods scream*

69
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:46,980
Okay.

70
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,330
I've had enough.

71
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,870
I've had fucking enough.

72
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:52,150
I've installed very little apps,

73
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,620
and I'm still facing this kind of problem.

74
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:55,520
That's it.

75
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:57,280
Guess who's getting the boot?

76
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:58,780
Google Services!

77
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:03,570
So with that, we're going to crDroid without Google Services.

78
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:07,450
So we're going to be destroying everything on this phone.

79
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,780
Oh my god.

80
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:10,900
That lag.

81
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,330
So we're going to be destroying everything on this phone,

82
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,830
and we're going to start fresh.

83
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,800
And as always,

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,050
ya girl's prepared.

85
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,020
While I work on that,

86
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:20,970
I'm going to have my moderator, Natalie,

87
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:21,870
Nat: Hi~

88
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,650
to check on me every once in a while

89
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,980
while I do my work.

90
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:25,520
Right!

91
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:27,400
So, without talking much,

92
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,770
without further ado, let's get straight to working on it.

93
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,400
VO MEL: Heya, voiceover Mel here.

94
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,830
This time, I'm going to be presenting this video a tad bit differently.

95
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,030
Considering how much can go wrong in this video,

96
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,420
I decided not to say the steps during filming,

97
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,630
and leave it to the voiceover to do it for me.

98
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:44,080
We'll start, of course, to shut down the phone.

99
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,350
And put the phone into Odin mode.

100
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,380
Flash the new crDroid recovery...

101
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:53,480
Until something went wrong on my PC.

102
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,600
Huh?

103
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,220
So Windows occasionally decides to be a goofball

104
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:58,700
and reset my drivers.

105
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:02,000
So to fix that, I got Zadig to overwrite to WinUSB

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,030
so Heimdall can detect the device properly.

107
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,770
The occasional problem you'll find is that

108
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:07,970
your phone might have two gadget serials.

109
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,070
So when it doesn't work...

110
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:09,800
LIVE MEL: Eh...

111
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,630
Okay, maybe it's the other gadget serial.

112
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:14,450
There's two gadget serials.

113
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,280
VO: And of fucking course, it works.

114
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:21,670
And now, we restart Odin mode.

115
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,930
LIVE: You know, recently, umm...

116
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,980
I started listening to Linkin Park's latest album.

117
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:33,200
It's called From Zero.

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,270
And I'm starting to take a liking of

119
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:36,720
this song in the album called

120
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:38,880
Up From The Bottom.
(Credit: Linkin Park YT, RIP potential monetization)

121
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:39,580
Because Emily…

122
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,470
Nat: I've not listened to Linkin Park in a long time.

123
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:42,170
Hmm.

124
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,020
Because Emily is like

125
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,980
really strong.

126
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,950
She feels like

127
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,750
the next generation of Chester Bennington
(Don't @ me, I'm not saying she REPLACES him.)

128
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,830
to an extent.

129
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,080
Nat: Hm. Cool.

130
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,520
She's got that strength.

131
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:55,830
And Mike Shinoda's back

132
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,600
to being a rapper again.

133
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,880
VO: That aside, something weird happened.

134
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,270
LIVE: Is this lineage recovery?

135
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,470
Or is this cr...?

136
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,870
Mel: I have a hard time believing.
Nat: Looks like Lineage to me.

137
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,650
Yeah, ah, like…

138
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:08,570
Huh...

139
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:11,380
Nat: crDroid has like a reddish hue.

140
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:12,670
Mel: Huh.

141
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,930
You know what's funny?

142
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,850
I got this recovery image

143
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,120
from the crDroid zip itself.

144
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:20,730
I was checking through

145
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,400
the official page,

146
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,020
the XDA official page,

147
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,700
and they said,

148
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,520
"My mistake, sorry.

149
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:30,320
You can actually grab the recovery image from ROM Zip

150
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:31,600
and install.

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,050
Previous recovery link was removed."

152
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,180
So I kind of instinctively went and did that.

153
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:37,720
LIVE: Right.

154
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:39,130
VO: So without knowing what went wrong,

155
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,100
I continued.

157
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,070
Yaaa, yeet~!

158
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,770
Yaaa, yeet~!

159
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,680
VO: I went on the flash like usual.

160
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:57,350
Very nice.

161
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:17,680
(*Humming Up From The Bottom*)

162
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:21,500
God, I really can't shake that song off of my head.

163
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,800
It's such an addicting song.

164
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,650
Nat: Hm.

165
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,930
VO: Until…

00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,970
Nat: Installation aborted? Huh...

168
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:33,000
SPL downgrade.

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,280
Security patch. Uh-huh...

170
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:36,520
I see.

171
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:38,070
Mel: Wow.

172
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,400
Truly unbelievable.

173
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,670
How the hell

174
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,920
did that even happen?

175
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,170
Nat: You might need to flash back to

176
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:49,080
the stock ROM of the Note 10 first and then try again.

177
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,720
Mel: Oh, god damn.

178
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:53,220
Nat: Yup, that's gonna be a process.

179

Mel: Oh my god.

180
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:57,030
VO: And off we go to fetch the stock ROM.

181
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,520

00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,930
VO: Only to realize that

187
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,570
WinUSB drivers don't work with Odin.

188
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:28,320
LIVE: And this driver is not friendly with Odin.

189
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:31,870
VO: Just replace it with whatever stock driver that was.

190
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:33,830
LIVE: Oh, there we go.

191
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,580
VO: Get all the binaries into Odin.

192
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,280
LIVE: There we go.

193
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:40,220
In theory, this is all we need.

194
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:42,880
And we'll have to run through the whole thing again.

195
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:45,520
VO: I dread for this.

196
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:53,250
LIV:E Ah, here we go.

197
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:00,130
Nat: Yay, stock rom.

198
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:01,470
Mel: Gosh darn it.

199
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:04,170
VO: Go through the setup like usual.

200
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,320
Make sure the OEM unlocking is present.

201
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:14,520
Because if it isn't,

202
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:16,820
that means you've not connected to the internet during setup

203
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:18,930
and activate the phone for flashing.

204
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,770
I got back to Odin mode once again.

205
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,070
Get the driver swapped back to WinUSB.

206
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:26,880
Flash like I'm supposed to.

207
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,050
Reboot into recovery.

208
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,270
Only to see the stock recovery.

209
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:36,320
LIVE: What?

210
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,030
Nat: Oh, I think OneUI might have replaced

211
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:42,650
the recovery when you booted into it.

212
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,880
Mel: Oh...

213
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:47,650
Nat: Yeah, that happens on Android phones sometimes.

214
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:50,320
Mel: Well, Samsung, you suck.

215
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,880
Something just crossed my mind for a second.

216
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:56,180
Why don't I boot into one UI right now?

217
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,900
If you've seen enough cartoons,

218
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,030
you would understand an analogy

219
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:02,600
I'm going to be doing right now.

220
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Instead of explaining the analogy,

221
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm gonna do the action

222
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:08,980
and see if you understand the analogy.

223
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,730
Nat: Alright, let's see.

224
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,470
(*Boot into stock recovery*)

225
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:17,670
(*Yeet the entire ROM*)

226
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,500
(*and it's cache partition for good measure*)

227
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,750
(*Power off the phone*)

228
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,370
(*Boot into Odin mode*)

229
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:30,470
(*Flash the crDroid Recovery*)

230
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:35,580
(*Without ROM, it'd guaranteed to boot into recovery*)

231
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,150
Boom

232
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,600
Ladies and gentlemen, we got 'em.

233
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,230
Nat: Hooray!

234
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:45,550
Actually, I wonder if the Lineage recovery

235
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:49,170
was overriding the crDroid

236
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:53,570
and that's what's causing the issue in the first place.

237
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,630
Mel: That might very well be, honestly.

238
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,870
VO: And with that out of the way,

239
00:09:56,866 --> 00:10:00,250
let's format the data and clean up.

240
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,800
And flash the CRDroid for real.

241
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:13,650
Once done, just reboot

242
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:16,670
since we aren't installing GApps.

243
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,100
Now that crDroid is working, let's set up like usual.

244
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,930
Just as I was going to complete the setup,

245
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,530
the navigation bar popped out

246
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,020
and interrupted the setup.

247
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:26,920
Eh.

248
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:30,900

250
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,520
I just mis-tapped.

251
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,700
(It) took me all the way back.

252
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,870
Ha ha ha.

253
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:41,800
♫Baby, take my hand.♫

254
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,520

00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:49,850
And "we love you 3000."

257
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,250
(Mel laughing)

258
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,580
VO: So I started installing Droid-ify, Aurora, and MicroG.

259
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,580
Because these will be our replacements to Google services.

260
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:02,320
But for some reason, MicroG wouldn't install through Droid-ify.

261
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:06,630
So we just got the APKs and installed it that way.

262
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,070
LIVE: Wow, that took long.

263
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:12,580
Say hi to us on Telegram.

264
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,200
Nice.

265
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,650
Now that we('ve) set up most of what we need,

266
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,280
there's still a few things left.

267
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:20,870
Customizing.

268
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:22,900
VO: So I bought an icon pack for no reason

269
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,100
and activated it through MicroG.

270
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,930
LIVE: Booyah.

271
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,500
VO: Got my launcher of choice,

272
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,020
set up a wallpaper.

273
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,470
(LIVE Mel laughing softly)

274
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,380
Nat: What are we laughing about?

275
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:37,830
Mel: The fact that I'm actually using

276
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:42,220
these two little nubbings to pinch and zoom.

277
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:44,630
Nat: Ah, yes.

278
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:47,700
Mel: One thing that did jump out to me

279
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,220
is that none of the clocks fit this wallpaper.

280
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:52,920
Nat: Unfortunate.

281
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,230
Mel: I guess we'll make do with that for now.

282
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:57,880
Oh, you can set them small again.

283
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,900
That's good.

284
00:11:58,899 --> 00:11:59,720
Nat: Yes.

285
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:03,250
Mel: That's definitely something.
Nat: (It's there since) uhh I think Android 13...

286
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,500
Mel: Doesn't this make it look like more of a Chinese phone kind of vibe?

287
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,300
Nat: Uhh yeah, it reminds me of like early MIUI days.

288
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,830
Mel: For real.

289
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,680
And there I go.

290
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,900
This is my Android phone for this period.

291
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,270
I'll be testing it out and

292
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:20,670
I'll be secondary daily driving it

293
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,670
and see whether I need Magisk or not.

294
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,430
But for now, I'm pretty satisfied with it.

295
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,970
So I'm going to continue doing all the rest of the setup and...

296
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:30,730
There is a few steps that did go wrong, but

297
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,450
I'm glad not too much has gone wrong.

298
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,920
And yeah, with that said,

299
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,750
thank you all so much for watching

300
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,470

301
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,520
Be sure to check out my Ko-fi if you would like to support me financially.

302
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:44,200
There's also Throne if you would like to give me some gifts.

303
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,870
If that's kind of your interest.

304
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,130
And also check out my YouTube memberships.

305
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:54,180
So Throne, Ko-fi, YouTube. They're all the same tier memberships.

306
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:56,720
You all will get the same type of access of content.

307
00:12:56,716 --> 00:12:58,330
And yeah.

308
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,000
Also be sure to check out my videos tab

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,250

and check out the live tab if you want more gaming

311
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,150
and shenanigans.

312
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:09,620
And time to tangent towards the sponsor of this video.

313
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:12,420
If you think I'm not going to take that opportunity to do that,

314
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,470
you'll be damn wrong.

315
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:16,320
So special thanks to SD Maid SE.

316
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:19,600
It's currently made by a singular person named Darken

317
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,620
and it is one of the greatest Android junk cleaner out there.

318
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,620
"Welcome! SD Maid SE manages file, apps, and storage.

319
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:29,570
Gain storage space by cleaning up behind other apps.

320
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:32,970
Delete expendable files and remove leftover data."

321
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,330
So basically junk.

322
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,850
And let's get through the setup as per usual.

323
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,250
(Fast frowarding...)

324
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,270
There we go.

325
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:43,730
How simple was that?

326
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:46,380
So at the moment, the free tier of SD Maid SE

327
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:49,930
only allows you to clean basic amount of app cleaning.

328
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,520
So if you like to go thorough with your app cleaning,

329
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:57,080
you would like to get the Pro license.

330
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:01,430
Right. Let's go through some of the settings because

331
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:03,880
usually I like doing settings.

332
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:07,100
So I usually like uninstall watcher because

333
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,400
when I uninstall the application,

334
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,830
it will just take charge and clear up after myself.

335
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,300
I usually don't have much to lose

336
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:17,750
because I usually take my stuff out first before I uninstall them.

337
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,620
So I'm not really that careless.

338
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:24,630
And… make sure we clean up ourselves very thoroughly.

339
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,250
Right. System stuff.

340
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,930
Superfluous APKs.

341
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,850
Basically, APKs of apps which you already installed

342
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,380
and are just leftovers.

343
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:34,250
Trashed...

344
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,070
Screenshots... I like to leave that.

345
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,120
Pretty much most of it.

346
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:40,580
AppCleaner. One of the highlight features out there.

347
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,280
If you like cache yeeted out of your system apps as well.

348
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,850
You can totally turn that on.

349
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,420
And… if you have include inaccessible caches,

350
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:53,980
that means you allow yourself to turn on accessibility service

351
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:57,330
and use accessibility service to tap those buttons for you.

352
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,270
And what I mean by those buttons,

353
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:02,070
if you go into App Info, you go to Storage and Cache

354
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,600
and you click Clear Cache.

355
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,230
That's simple for one app.

356
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:09,480
But what if you have tens and maybe even hundred...

357
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:10,480
A hundred apps.

358
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,700
That's gonna drive you fucking crazy, doesn't it?

359
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,700
And this is what makes SD Maid SE super freaking useful.

360
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,500
It does all of that for you automatically.

361
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,950
Well, I wouldn't say fully automatically,

362
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,500
but on your demand automatically.

363
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,330
So it taps those buttons for you.

364
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,030
So you don't have to go crazy for that.

365
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,600
Bug reporting...

366
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,880
I would like to keep game files

367
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:33,370
because I do play games like Blue Archive.

368
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,200
Offline Cache... It would be very helpful

369
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,070
if I'm using Google Maps or something else.

370
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:40,270
Recycle Bin... Yeah, you can go.

371
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:45,130
And… Other chatting apps that I don't ever use.

372
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:47,620
Right. That looks fine to me...

373
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:49,120
That looks fine to me.

374
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,920
Right, let's go through each of them.

375
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,280
So what CorpseSFinder does is

376
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,350
when you've uninstalled an application

377
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,370
and there's bound to be shit left over.

378
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:59,470
So CorpseFinder is basically it.

379
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:01,420
And getting into SystemCleaner,

380
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:05,020
it basically clears out stuff in your system like empty folders

381
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:09,430
that are just there and it looks kind of an OCD mess to you.

382
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:12,600
Or maybe log files or other kinds of stuff.

383
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,870
And stuff that you have picked in your settings as well.

384
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:17,380
Like I said earlier, Superfluous APKs

385
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:20,130
We'll totally be chucking them out of the window.

386
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,830
And then App Cleaner, just like we said.

387
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,120
So caches that are inaccessible

388
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,100
are those that we click using Clear Cache.

389
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,650
And then those that are accessible are

390
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:33,470
those that SD Maid can reach through its available file access API,

391
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:36,530
or (known as) Storage Access Framework (SAF).

392
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,820
So when you press Delete, it will do that

393
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:43,230
and then it will do all of these for you.

394
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:46,280
Look at how quickly it does this job.

395
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:49,070
It's insane.

396
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,380
There are bound to be a few (left),

397
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:53,350
however those can't really be done.

398
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,480
Because if you go into those applications

399
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:57,650
they don't really have a Clear Cache button

400
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,350
or they have them grayed out.

401
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,480
Primarily because,

402
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:03,100
if you have turned on Include System Applications

403
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,700
you're bound to find some of these kinds of apps.

404
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,070
So there's really not much you can do with that.

405
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:11,300
No app can allow you to do that because this is system locked.

406
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:12,580
But that's perfectly fine.

407
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,520
You're already doing the most

408
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,020
and that's all that important.

409
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:17,530
But with that said,

410
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:18,370
that's done.

411
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:19,320
Eyyy~

412
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:20,720
"Spotless."

413
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,880
And once again, huge special thanks

414
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:25,670

434

Oh wait, I forgot you haven't spoke in that part.

439
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,880
Mel: Sorry!

440
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:29,130
I have to do a retake then. Fuck it.

441
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:32,380
Nat: All good, all good.
Mel: Oh god...
