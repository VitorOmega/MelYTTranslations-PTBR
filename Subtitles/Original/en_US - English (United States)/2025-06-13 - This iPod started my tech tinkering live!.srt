1
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:05,700
Ain't it old?

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,830
KonMelo, it's ya Tech Wizardess Girl, MeloriTensei.

3
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:12,670
And this is a very, very old device.

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,130
So let's ask ourselves this old question.

5
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,280
Is this an iPhone?

6
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:24,100
No, it's not.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,520
So this right here is an iPod Touch 4th generation.

8
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:30,930
So iPod Touch 4G as we call it in short.

9
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:34,730
And I had great fond memories with this device,

10
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:39,330
primarily because this was what introduced me to iOS.

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,750
So a little backstory here,

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,980
but I don't think you guys will be that interested,

13
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:44,530
even though you clicked into this video

14
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:46,170
wanting to know about my history.

15
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,620
Imagine this, PapaMel and MamaMel

16
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,720
wanted to get me a birthday present.
(MamaMel: Honey, what do you think should be our kid's gift this year?)

17
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:52,880
And they have this very weird (thing)
(PapaMel: Well, he* is very into technology.)

18
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:55,770
of wanting to get me the coolest thing at the time.
(PapaMel: So, let's get the coolest thing at this time)

19
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:58,030
However, instead of getting me an iPhone,

20
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,480
they chose to get me an iPod Touch because

21
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:02,420
it was cheaper than an iPhone.

22
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,870
See, I told you it was quite an unimpressive story.

23
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,200
But nonetheless, the good part about having an iPod Touch is

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,520
it's got more or less

25
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:12,820
the same things that you get out of an iPhone,

26
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:14,030
just without cellular.

27
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:17,870
And it does pretty much a lot of stuff that iPhones can,

28
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:19,920
but without the ability to call

29
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:23,180
because there's no cellular in there.

30
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,150
Oh, does it start?

31
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,380
Oh, it's dead.

32
00:01:27,383 --> 00:01:29,050
Well, this is what happens when

33
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,920
you don't film a video for four months straight.

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's get it charged up.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,220
I got myself this really, really old cable.

36
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:40,750
I got this back when I used to have an iPhone 4S

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,830
and surprisingly, it's still with me

38
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,430
and it has yellowed.

39
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:54,050
God, that was terrible.

40
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,270
Oh, look.

41
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,530
Look, guys.

42
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:01,530
It's very, very faint, but you can, you guys can see it's charging.

43
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:06,030
So surprisingly, this thing is alive.

44
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,770
Oh, my God, it turned on that quick.

45
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:12,050
I'm not even done talking yet.

46
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,800
Hello?

47
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,420
What?

48
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,580
What?!

49
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,320
What the fuck???

50
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:25,570
I have never seen something like this happen.

51
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:29,180
Oh, oh, oh, we're going again.

52
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,880
Is it going to turn on? Come on.

53
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:34,980
I feel like I'm learning from DankPods, just...

54
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:37,780
clicking my fingers on the, on the device.

55
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:39,820
I'm sorry, Wade.

57
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:41,730
You influenced me.

58
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,200
Come on.

59
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,450
Wake up.

60
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,080
Wake up!

61
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,520
Okay, let's try not be harsh.

62
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:52,470
This device is a fa-

63
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,050
What?

64
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,970
No-, NOT AGAIN!

65
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,580
NOT AGAIN!

66
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,700
WHY!!

67
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:01,320
Okay, let's keep it this way for now.

68
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:03,850
Who knows it'll turn back on in a-

69
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,580
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT IT!

70
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,530
Okay, let's just continue yapping.

71
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:11,830
So, a few years after, I also learned about

72
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,430
this very interesting thing called jailbreaking.

73
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:17,250
It was also when I discovered that tinkering

74
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,170
was very much my favorite thing to do at the time,

75
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,220
and it was fun to solve problems...

76
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:24,370
Are you dead again?

77
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:26,300
Yep, you're dead again.

78
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,630
When will you wake up anyways?

79
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,070
Oh, here we go again.

80
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,420
God damn it.

81
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,630
So anyways, I discovered that I love solving problems

82
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:37,230
that existed either because of limitations

83
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,930
or people just don't feel like programming it into.

84
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,380
So one of my favorite things was,

85
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:47,320
was I want to play a game that had local network multiplayer.

86
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:52,030
So I thought maybe I should host my own mini hotspot from this iPod.

87
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:55,880
But if you think about it, you can only host a hotspot in iOS

88
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:58,050
when you have cellular connection,

89
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,400
which this iPod does not, but the iPhone does.

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,980
So how do I get around solving this problem?

91
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:07,230
So I found out that there's a tweak that you can use in Cydia,

92
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:11,580
which is the biggest package manager for jailbreaking in the old days.

93
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,480
Shout out to you guys who remember Cydia.

94
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:16,830
Also, o7 to Saurik, great work.

95
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,020
You may rest.

96
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:20,470
Also this thing has been going on and off.

97
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,980
What are you doing?

98
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:26,580
Okay, I plugged into somewhere better.

99
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,370
Hopefully this boots up this time.

100
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:30,770
I don't know what's happening with my power supply.

101
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:34,170
But anyways, I realized that by jailbreaking,

102
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,120
it allows me to install this tweak

103
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,680
and I can do whatever the heck I want.

104
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:41,350
And that was kind of a weird sense of freedom

105
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,070
to an extent, if you ask me.

106
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:46,670
And it kind of feels like I've never turned back.

107
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,670
Well, not really.

108
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,220
I did restore multiple times and then I come back to it every time.

109
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:55,800
And jailbreaking on and off was kind of fun in my opinion.

110
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,970
(iOS 6 charging sound)

111
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh...

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,870
Oh, it booted!

113
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,680
I heard the charging sound.

114
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:03,900
Hell yeah, let's go.

115
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:06,770
Hell yeah, let's go.
(FREEDOM INTENSIFIES, EAGLES, GUNSHOTS)

116
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,630
Ah~

117
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,280
Oh, that felt satisfying.

118
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:13,100
(Mel processing: ...)

119
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,220
Eyyy, Cydia~.

120
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,570
I will never forget about you, fuck.

121
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:20,700
Although the servers are dead, but...
(Correction: Not the servers, rather the billing system.)

122
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,680
Who knows? Maybe it will work again.

123
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:23,420
Let's see.

124
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,700
Well, it's serviceable, I guess.

125
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,420
Well, there may be some, maybe some repos are still up.

126
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,370
Who knows?

127
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,600
Yeah, I would pretty much expect it from the death of Cydia.
(Correction: It ain't dead. What's wrong with you, Past Mel?)

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,630
But there seems to be a lot of things that you can still do

129
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:41,170
on this iPod with Cydia installed.

130
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:45,830
So truth be told, I don't really regret jailbreaking the old iPod.

131
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,520
Although it is a little stressful

132
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:49,420
when you're jailbreaking modern phones,

133
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,750
especially with my bank

134
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,480
whom we're going to be calling Omnibus Bank A.

135
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,680
Curse you, Bank A.

136
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:58,180
If you want more context, check out my Razer phone video.

137
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:02,870
But that aside, this iPod has been still a very well capable device.

138
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:06,030
So if you guys want me to do experiment video

139
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,700
for a video idea, please let me know in the comments below

140
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,080
because I will look forward to trying out some stuff,

141
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,850
but make sure it better be interesting,

142
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,600
not just something simple as, oh, changing a theme.

143
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,630
And speaking of changing the theme,

144
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:22,120
that's my second favorite thing to do after jailbreaking.

145
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:26,480
So changing themes kind of gave out that new weird sense of vibes.

146
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:30,400
So for you Android people, imagine changing launchers

147
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,350
and imagine changing icon packs.

148
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,830
That was literally something new,

149
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:40,370
at least for iOS users back in iOS 4, 5, 6, so forth.

150
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,930
It was kind of a game changer to the iPhones

151
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:49,120
because iOS was and still is a very restrictive platform.

152
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:53,570
So, figuring out some of the tweaks and hacks kind of fascinated me,

153
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:56,420
and it makes me want to do more tweaking to this.

154
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,780
Unfortunately, nowadays, I don't really do that

155
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:01,930
because my daily driver, iPhone 12 Pro Max,

156
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:05,250
unfortunately is also my bank mobile,

157
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,230
which means jailbreaking is not really the answer for me anymore.

158
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:12,930
However, I do sideload, but not for many apps,

159
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,370
just like small things that changes small things.

160
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:19,180
I don't really want to sideload something massive

161
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:21,600
that could become catastrophic emotionally

162
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,450
when I accidentally change from Sideloadly to AltStore

163
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,580
to SideStore to Sideloadly again.

164
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,230
But that aside, tangents aside,

165
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:34,200
this iPod Touch has been very important to me in the past,

166
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,220
 primarily because it was my primary entertainment device

167
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:41,180
before I had those phones that I have mentioned in the past.

168
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:42,970
And it does pretty much everything.

169
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:45,320
At the time, if you're wondering what phone I was using,

170
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:48,450
I was using a Sony Ericsson.

171
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,630
I don't remember which model it is, but..

172
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:54,780
I'll stick some of the images of some of the Sony Ericsson phones
(W200i, W705, Xperia X10 Mini)

173
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:55,980
that I used in the past

174
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:58,020
that I can probably to an extent confirm

175
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:00,550
that I have indeed used by my memory.

176
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,980
But I was using a Sony Ericsson phone in the past

177
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,220
as my daily driver mobile phone.

178
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:08,070
That was before the smartphone era, at least for myself.

179
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:12,180
But the iPod was sort of a transition to smartphones for me,
(Technically the X10Mini is a "smartphone" as it ran Android 2.1)

180
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:16,750
where I learned to familiarize with a smartphone operating system
(but sentimentally, I didn't think of it as one.)

181
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,600
and understand how smartphones do things differently

182
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,800
from old Java mobile phones.

183
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,730
Like, you interact with what's called applications.

184
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:29,470
Sure, applications do exist back in Sony Ericsson, Nokia phones,

185
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:33,750
but the things that it can do on iOS was a lot more than those.

186
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,280
So that was what fascinated me and wanted to discover more,

187
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:40,500
hence why I wanted to jailbreak at that time.

188
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,180
And the next thing that I wanted to discover was kind of...

189
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:45,920
sort of weird and interesting. Umm...

190
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,950
So fast forward to a couple of years later,

191
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,020
I got myself an iPad mini,

192
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:52,150
and you might have seen it in the Slime VR video,

193
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,530
that particular iPad.

194
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,370
So in that iPad, I've done jailbreaking again because

195
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,980
I don't really see the reason why not to.

196
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:02,770
It was sort of a fun thing for me to play around

197
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:06,450
and burn my free time and just learning about iOS in general 

198
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,700
without restrictions.

199
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,970
And I kind of hit a mini mental roadblock

200
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:14,020
where I was playing this game called Terraria,

201
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:15,030
and I thought to myself,

202
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:17,780
how do I make this experience a whole lot better to myself?

203
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:22,300
And it turns out some games at the time do support controllers,

204
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:27,170
but it was kind of a very weird sense of a driver support.

205
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,850
It was very half-baked. It was terrible.

206
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,220
It's like it works with Xbox controllers,

207
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:34,980
and then it doesn't work with any other kinds of controllers.

208
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:38,030
And that's where jailbreaking kicks in again.

209
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:41,870
So I've installed a tweak that supported DualShock controllers,
(Not my vid, but the exact illustration. Credit: Co0per)

210
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,320
because at the time, I had a DualShock 3.

211
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:46,880
So I connected my DualShock 3, and...

212
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:48,120
and the tweak just kicked in

213
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:50,430
and pretended to be an Xbox controller.

214
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,670
And boom, I'm off to the races.

215
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,820
Terraria.

216
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:55,270
I can play with a controller now.

217
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:58,400
I can just grab a small elastic band and

218
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,030
stick the iPad to the headrest of a car

219
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,620
and just play Terraria there.

220
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:05,720
Oh, God.

221
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:07,820
If you have not done that in your past,

222
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,050
what are you doing in your life?

223
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:14,080
Okay, in all seriousness, well, we live in the age

224
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,530
of people using phone clamps and stuff

225
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,900
and tablet clamps for the headrest

226
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,230
instead of using janky things like using elastics

227
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:24,700
and just tie it on the headrest like I did.

228
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,220
But to be fair, to be fair, it was something of a fun experience,

229
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:31,130
especially when you have Asian parents

230
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:35,770
who refuses to upgrade their car in no matter what circumstances.

231
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,550
Imagine driving a Lada.

232
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,820
Well, not really a Lada.

233
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:41,470
I'm just putting this as an illustrative purposes.

234
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,230
But you get the analogy.

235
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:44,970
It's kind of hilarious.

236
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:47,680
So this iPad and the iPod

237
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:50,080
had been my source of entertainment that way.

238
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,570
And I gotta be honest,

239
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:54,280
I had a lot of fun messing around with jailbreaking

240
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:55,430
and stuff like that.

241
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:59,750
Another thing that got me discovering the iPod is FaceTime.

242
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,180
Sure, there isn't many Apple users at the time,

243
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:05,050
but when you do finally FaceTime someone,

244
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:07,850
it's sort of magical to an extent.

245
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,930
I wouldn't call it magical at a greater scale

246
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:13,150
because at the time, Skype exists,

247
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,800
RIP Skype, o7.

248
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,170
God... Microsoft.

249
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,800
And we still do call people over Skype at the time,

250
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,980
but FaceTime was sort of...

251
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,750
The hardwareis already there, the software is already there.

252
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,280
You just need to have a friend that have the same set of things

253
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:27,330
in one package.

254
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,380
And I know I'm doing a little way too much

255
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:30,730
Apple shilling here and there,

256
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,070
but let's not forget about one interesting thing

257
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:36,920
that got me to being interested in doing YouTube videos,

258
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,620
the included YouTube app in iOS.

259
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,280
Too bad you don't see them here because they're gone-zo.

260
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:45,170
So, um, the agreement between YouTube and Apple

261
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,550
kind of died somewhere and the app is no longer included.

262
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:51,020
And I'm just like, what the hell are they doing?

263
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:53,350
But nonetheless, I did figure it out that

264
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,550
you can go to the App Store to get the YouTube app.

265
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,700
So, there's that.

266
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,030
Happy ending for me, I guess.

267
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,420
But nonetheless, I was watching YouTube

268
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,580
and, um, as you can tell, I was an iPad kid,

269
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,650
but I could probably even call myself the iPod kid

270
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:09,280
because I started out on this iPod and

271
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:12,300
the iPad came way late, way, way, way late.

272
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,330
So this iPod was very much the gateway to the internet for me

273
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:20,450
because you got Safari, you got App Store, you got the YouTube app

274
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,120
and well, to be fair, nobody uses iMessage

275
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:26,770
and I mean nobody in my, in my vincity.

276
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:31,330
I did not get to use iMessage a lot, but hey, at least Skype exists.

277
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,620
I don't remember if Skype...

278
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:35,200
the Skype app existed during the iPod era,

279
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,000
but I still think of this as like my multimedia entertainment device

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,150
because I do use iTunes to stick movies in there.

281
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,850
At least that's what I do in the past.

282
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,970
I don't anymore because there's such things like Files app and VLC.

283
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:51,230
So things have changed a lot

284
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:53,100
as opposed to that time of the era

285
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,300
where you do not have access to your own files in the system

286
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,130
or not even have a sandbox of it.

287
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,720
So you do have to put it in the videos section.

288
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:02,100
Well, currently there's no videos.

289
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,620
Oh well.

290
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,480
But I also do put music in there

291
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,920
and it was kind of an all-in-one thing for me

292
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:11,470
and I will never forget the great history that the iPod has given me

293
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:15,580
that led to me taking a liking to tweaking mobile devices

294
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,770
to solve problems.

295
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:20,330
So if you're new to this channel, hi, I'm Melori Valentine.

296
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,370
I go by she/her,

297
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:24,530
and I love tweaking stuff to solve problems,

298
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,170
primarily to solve problems.

299
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,880
Not exactly to discover things,

300
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:30,070
but it does let me discover things at times.

301
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:30,830
But nonetheless,

302
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,170
if you guys have any interesting stories about the iPod,

303
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,800
please let me know in the comments below

304
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,130
or maybe I don't know,

305
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,120
share some stuff that you do with the iPod back in your days

306
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:42,020
because I've just talked about what I've done

307
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:43,780
with my iPod back in my days.

308
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,220
So why don't you?

309
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:48,120
Otherwise, be sure to like, subscribe, and...

310
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:51,050
I hope you enjoyed this little story time about this iPod.

311
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:54,630
And I'm terribly sorry that this video is a very simple video.

312
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,930
I initially had a very big project for a video,

313
00:13:56,933 --> 00:14:00,130
but unfortunately that went catastrophically terrible 

314
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:02,480
and I had to change course.

315
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:04,700
So hopefully this buys me time to...

316
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,170
solve some of the issues before I...

317
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,880
actually come back and make a video about it.

318
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:11,470
But yeah, with that said, thank you all so much for watching.

319

OtsuMelo deshita (It's been ya girl, Mel).

320
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,900
I've got more story times.

321
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:14,650
So see ya.

322
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:16,520
