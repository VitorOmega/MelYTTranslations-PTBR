1
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:05,180
Did you get the hint?

2
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:08,630
Still not?

3
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:12,940
Is that enough for you?

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,830
Not enough?

5
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,850
Still not enough?

6
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:27,730
Oh fuck, it stopped the recording!

7
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:29,750
Fuck!

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,250
Take 2

9
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:36,250
I wonder if you got the hint.

10
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,380
Still not enough?

11
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:43,180
Is that not enough?

12
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:46,280
More?

13
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,710
That should give a hint.

14
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:49,410
Kon-Melo!

15
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,830
It's ya tech wizardess girl, MeloriTensei!

16
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:56,960
And as you can see with this chaos clump of technologies right now,

17
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,760
you may not understand what this means.

18
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:01,130
Why is there two VR controllers

19
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:06,660
and one, two, three, four devices,

20
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,250
and one more to come later, on the table.

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,330
Well if you've read the title of this video

22
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,380
you would understand that yes,

23
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,960
I'm strapping these things on my body.

24
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:16,540
For what?

25
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,030
For VR.

26
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:22,590
So if you don't know, there's this project out there called SlimeVR.

27
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,150
So what SlimeVR does is that they basically took what's already

28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,860
in the technology of the phones,

29
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:32,930
like the accelerometer, the gyroscope,

30
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:36,980
and all kinds of motion-related sensors in the device,

31
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:40,760
made it simpler in a tiny PCB, a dedicated one,
(Correction: "Simpler in the sense of making out of inexpensive components on a PCB)

32
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,400
and booyah, you got a tracker.
(Credit: Sorakage033 on GitHub)

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,230
And then if you combine five of them,

34
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:48,000
you got yourself a full lower body skeleton.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,930
Why five of them?

36
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:53,710
That's because primarily the data that is available for the accelerometer

37
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:58,710
is not enough to form up three, like say two legs and a hip.

38
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:04,000
Unfortunately that's not enough because it doesn't know precisely how far it goes,

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,960
but it does know approximately how far it goes.

40
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,380
So it's not position perfect.

41
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:11,510
There may be a bit of yaw here and there,

42
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:15,930
but that's something that can be fixed pretty easily honestly.

43
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:21,110
However, what if we take this, we take whatever SlimeVR has done

44
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:24,230
in the current time, and we return to the monkey days
(SlimeVR Docs also points out that the experience I'm attempting will be "subpar")

45
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,300
and use the very device that inspired it.
(Not really "inspired". Idk why I said that >.<)

46
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,410
So we're going to put this away and maybe make some room for this.

47
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,940
Let's give the iPhone a spotlight, I suppose.

48
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:37,480
So you haven't watched the prior video of mine

49
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,210
of replacing the battery for this phone,

50
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:41,910
then you wouldn't understand why this phone came to be.

51
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,500
So I've done some more experiments, jailbroken and stuff like that.

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,650
That's primarily because I was trying to archive the app in question,

53
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,400
but to no avail, I'm still not at that level of expertise

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,190
to archive the app just yet.

55
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,760
But that's fine, that's perfectly fine.

56
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:59,510
I am in no rush of doing it.

57
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:02,530
So the app in question that we're looking for right now is…

58
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,260
OwO-

59
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,210
Track.

60
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,660
Are you okay?

61
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,260
Hello?

62
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, it doesn't work with this tip.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,880
Hold on.

64
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,510
Much better.

65
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:18,630
There we go.

66
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,280
So the app in question that we're looking for is OwOTrack.

67
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:24,560
And as you can see, it shows motion sensor, accelerometer,

68
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:26,860
gyroscope, magnetometer.

69
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:30,730
It's using every available sensor that has something to do with motion

70
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:35,580
to create a positional data to send to a central server,

71
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:39,410
but not external central server, just central in the way that

72
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:43,260
it is in your computer to create a skeleton.

73
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,460
But we'll get to that in a moment.

74
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:47,230
We'll explain how that works in a moment.

75
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,650
But first things first, what we need to do is we have to

76
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,300
go to the connect tab and type down the IP address of the said device

77
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,580
that we're going to be on.

78
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,230
However, there are some things we still have to do prior.

79
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:04,330
So what we need to do is create a wifi hotspot

80
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:08,090
from the PC that you want to have your VR session in.

81
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,960
Well, that's mostly for latency reasons,

82
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,660
but if you're really, really close to the router,

83
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,010
you don't really have to do that at all.

84
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:16,250
But because I'm kind of far away from the router,

85
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,780
it may be a necessity for me.

86
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:20,750
So we're going to get into that.

87
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,330
Right.

88
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,860
It's been a while since we're back on the desktop.

89
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:28,210
So what we want to do is we're going to have our settings tab.

90
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:34,440
And what we want from here is we'll create a mobile hotspot that is on wifi,

91
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,780
specifically on 2.4 Ghz, because you'll thank me later in the future.

92
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:43,680
But it's mostly because it's far easier when it comes to coverage wise,

93
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:49,930
if you're a little bit far or if you're in a radio noisy environment

94
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:53,910
or particularly 5 Ghz, especially when it's in the trend these days,

95
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,430
then 2.4 might be a good option sometimes.

96
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:01,660
It may be particularly 2.4 Ghz noisy in some other places,

97
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,690
but depending on the situation of the wifi in your area,

98
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,980
feel free to choose accordingly.

99
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:10,390
But in my specific case, it would be 5 Ghz noisy.

100
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,430
So I would choose the other instead

101
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:15,210
where it's a little bit quiet on 2.4 at the moment.

102
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:18,330
So with that said, let's turn on the mobile hotspot.

103
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,680
And what we want to do is we're going to try to connect to it right now.

104
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,010
After some time of connecting all devices to the same network...

105
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:27,260
Now depending on whether you're using a mobile hotspot from Windows

106
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:30,710
or you're on your local network, this might differ a whole lot.

107
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:34,330
So in my case, specifically on a Windows hotspot,

108
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,310
since the computer in question is hosted on exactly the same machine

109
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:40,310
where the skeleton server is going to be,

110
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:42,980
which is known as the SlimeVR server,

111
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:46,210
we only need to refer to the address known as the router.

112
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:49,660
However, if you're using your existing local connections,

113
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,890
then the local IP for the SlimeVR server would be your answer.

114
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,180
So once you've typed down the IP address that you're looking for,

115
00:05:57,183 --> 00:06:01,750
we're going to prepare the other devices to also all do the same.

116
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,010
And hello, Redmi.

117
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:08,890
So if you've seen the previous video where I talked about holding onto a Redmi

118
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:13,000
as a contracted phone, then you know that I was going to plan to do something

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,190
with the device.

120
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,690
However, for this very video, we're going to be doing something a little different.

121
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,130
Considering this video being a SlimeVR video,

122
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:25,250
we're heavily focusing on using the phones as the way they are for a tracker.

123
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,440
So currently it's on crDroid in case you're wondering,

124
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,480
because LineageOS has been discontinued for this phone.

125
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:34,660
Not exactly discontinued, more like there's absolutely no maintainer,

126
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:38,800
so there are some maintainers on the good guys at crDroid,

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,510
so I'm just settling in crDroid for the time being.

128
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:44,580
It won't be on crDroid for long.

129
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,690
But regardless, we got OwOTrack installed on Android as well,

130
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,350
as you can see, it's not just iOS, Android has it too as well.

131
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,510
So we're going to do exactly the same.

132
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:58,010
So we're going to input the IP address for the SlimeVR server,

133
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,600
and then we just, we'll press connect later.

134
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,350
We're going to hold onto it for now, and push that aside.

135
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,010
We're going to do the same for the other devices that we have,

136
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:09,910
and sometimes auto-connect works.

137
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,860
Oh, it filled itself in, let's go.

138
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,980
That is if you actually have SlimeVR already turned on

139
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:18,180
in the background on your computer.

140
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:23,310
And finally, the big ol' iPad.

141
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:24,230
Oh damn.

142
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,100
Hey, Vei.

143
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,460
Okay, we got all the IPs written down,

144
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:33,710
and you could also do a test connection if you already have turned it on prior,

145
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,760
like I did just mention before.

146
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:38,850
And now we're getting ready.

147
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,860
So we're going to need to hop over to the computer side of things

148
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:43,010
to take care of this.

149
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:46,460
Right, so now what we've got to do is, we're going to open up SlimeVR.

150
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,350
Feel free to put it on full screen if you feel like it,

151
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,060
so let's get it all set up.

152
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:53,660
And usually with traditional SlimeVR equipment,

153
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,730
you are expected to type in your Wi-Fi credentials first

154
00:07:56,733 --> 00:08:00,760
because what it needs to do is to apply these Wi-Fi settings through cable,

155
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:05,660
because these tiny custom PCB chips are instructed to do very, very specific things,

156
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:10,940
and this SlimeVR program is meant to program these things to do so.

157
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,380
However, since we're putting those IP address ourselves,

158
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:15,560
we'll have to skip the Wi-Fi settings for now.

159
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:17,460
And what we want to do right now is,

160
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:20,050
we're going to turn on every single one instance,

161
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,280
so like all of these down here.

162
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:24,000
Alright, once everything's connected,

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
we're going to start setting them accordingly.

164
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,690
So this is where you're going to need to know

165
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,480
which device goes to which part of your body,

166
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:34,350
because we're going to need to start assigning those trackers accordingly.

167
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,890
So for now, we're going to need to set a lower body set because,

168
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,830
or you could set the core set instead,

169
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,360
because we're going to need the hip tracking instead of the chest tracking.

170
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:46,100
And I'll explain why later.
(I ended up forgetting to explain: The iPad can't mount on my body, unless I use tape, it hurts.)

171
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,810
So first up, I'm going to decide that I want this iPhone to be my left ankle.

172
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:56,060
So the good part is that as long as you're connected to SlimeVR,

173
00:08:56,066 --> 00:09:00,610
whatever movements you're doing, it can be seen on SlimeVR on the computer.

174
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:02,080
So you can see that it's glowing,

175
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,500
that's because I'm doing intense motion like this.
("intense motion")

176
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,100
So it's showing some form of activity.

177
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,850
So we're going to need to click on that,

178
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,780
then we know that it is this tracker.

179
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,160
So now that we've set this one,

180
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,280
we're going to set it aside and get onto the next one.

181
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:18,710
So I probably want this one to be set to my right ankle.

182
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:20,080
So let's do this.

183
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,830
And we know that it is this one.

184
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,910
We can rename that in the future,

185
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,230
but for now, we just don't have that choice just yet.

186
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,480
And then probably we would want that for the thighs.

187
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:33,030
So maybe this one for the left thigh.

188
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:33,760
Right.

189
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:36,030
We got that one taken care of.

190
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:40,660
And we got one more, that is the hip.

191
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,980
Okay, now that we got all the parts, wait a second.

192
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:48,260
The right thigh is not even set, but I ran out of device on my table.

193
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:48,960
Hmm.

194
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,010
One moment.

195
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,630
I canibalized my tracking iPhone for this vid.

196
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,610
You won't expect this phone to be joining the SlimeVR video.

197
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:59,200
That's because this is actually my real daily driver

198
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,810
and I don't really show my actual stuff because of privacy reasons.

199
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:06,430
Well, welcome to the gang, I suppose.

200
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:10,180
And we're going to connect it and assign that to the right thigh.

201
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:11,960
All right, with everything set up,

202
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,450
we're going to head on to the next step.

203
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,610
So right here is where it's expected you

204
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,350
to have already mounted the devices onto yourself.

205
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,460
So, but Mel, they're phones.

206
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:24,110
How do you expect to strap devices onto yourself?

207
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:24,930
What are you going to use?

208
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:26,030
Fucking tape?

209
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,640
I got one better than you.

210
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:28,930
Wait a second.

211
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:33,390
So I went to AliExpress and looked for the cheapest thing

212
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,660
that I could use to strap phones on myself.

213
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:39,660
So I got phone straps.

214
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:46,640
And all we got to do is get all these devices placed into the straps.

215
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:47,730
Like this.

216
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:51,830
Right, once you got the phone in the phone stash thingy-majig,

217
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,210
you're going to want the phone, the upper side of the phone,

218
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:55,630
like facing up like this.

219
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,390
We're going to want it to be,

220
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,410
hello,
(Leg reveal? O.O)

221
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,100
on your legs, facing upwards towards you.

222
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,780
Kind of like when the leg is flowing up towards you and your body.

223
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:09,080
So you're going to want it in that general direction

224
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,010
when you put phones on yourself.

225
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:16,580
That applies to every single phone, including the thigh one and the hips.

226
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,660
So you're going to want to do that

227
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,210
because primarily this is the best for its tracking.

228
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:25,280
Same could be applied for even the general Slime VR tracker.

229
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,280
You're going to need that as well.

230
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,530
Now it can be a little bit difficult to walk in phones

231
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:33,980
because that's not really the actual intended use of a phone.

232
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:38,350
So you either just get used to it or, I don't know,

233
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,180
engineer something, I guess.

234
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,500
Now that we got all strapped up,

235
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,760
what we're going to do is we're going to try to

236
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:50,830
get to automatic mounting and make sure that all your trackers

237
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,950
are set up correctly.

238
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,980
So that includes putting on your headset

239
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:58,530
and moving your hips and see if your hips are

240
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,280
also doing all that job.

241
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:05,710
Your legs, your feet, your thighs, and your hand controllers.

242
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:08,580
So I'm controlling this interface right now

243
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:14,750
using the SteamVR desktop interface right now so it'll be more easier.

244
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,980
So what you want to do is I have my all trackers on

245
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:21,180
and what it wants you to do right now is stand straight,

246
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:25,830
like put your hands on the side, and also stand up straight

247
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,860
so that it detects everything for a full reset.

248
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:37,230
Once you've done that, what you want to do is get squatting.

249
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:41,380
You're going to need to squat, which could also mean destroying my phone straps,

250
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:43,460
but whatevs, it's for a video.

251
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,660
So you're going to need to squat down really, really hard.

252
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,880
You can see on that next panel that I am trying really hard.

253
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:50,780
And we're going to need to get them a little back,

254
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:54,560
like as you can see, this curves in the hand like that.

255
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,880
It's almost like you're actually skiing, so do that.

256
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,290
And once you've done that, in theory it works.

257
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:08,960
However, if you're wondering what's with my hands overlapping each other,

258
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:13,230
that's just a bug in which controller it actually is using.

259
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:14,360
It's kind of hilarious.

260
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:18,110
It's having difficulties differentiating what's left and what's right.

261
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:20,110
So, eh.

262
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:22,140
But now that you look carefully,

263
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,860
you'll notice that it's actually fully working now.

264
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:25,730
Look at that.

265
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,030
How cool is that?

266
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:30,100
Ah, I almost dropped the phone.

267
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:31,750
I gotta be really careful.

268
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,100
And I can kind of move my thigh as you can see,

269
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,710
kind of, to some extent.

270
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:38,480
So I can also move my ankles a little bit.

271
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:41,710
Let me try to move over to the side.

272
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:42,230
I mean not to the side, to the front.

273
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:46,960
Like I can kind of shift my ankles like that.

274
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:50,460
It's kind of janky, but to be fair, it's a phone

275
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,390
and you can't really expect too much from it.

276
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,450
If you want a more precise tracking, it's always better

277
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,010
to use a more proper SlimeVR tracker.

278
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:02,010
However, as it currently stands, it somehow works, I guess.

279
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:06,000
This entire section of video was rejected for being INSANELY INACCURATE.
Thus, here's Editor Mel.

280
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,980
Simply, the job Body Proportions does is measuring the trackers
so the measurement is accurate matching the real world to SteamVR.

281
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:13,210
Start off with checking whether your tracks (including your hand controllers)
are working. Then, do a full reset as instructed.

282
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:16,880
Back to the Video Mel!

283
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:20,540
And it's gonna want you to do very specific instructions

284
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:25,180
and you're gonna need to follow precisely what they want on the screen.

285
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:26,460
You gotta follow the steps.

286
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,380
So you can feel free to pause this part of the video

287
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:33,330
and read what they have there, but I'm going to follow it as it is.
(The next part is skipped for privacy reasons. Please use your accurate height)

288
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,140
(to avoid offsetting the virtual trackers it's gonna deploy on SteamVR)

289
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,180
Now that we got to this step, you can feel free to press play

290
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:39,850
and then it's going to tell you what you want to do.

291
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,880
So it has to be specifically these steps in sequence

292
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,330
and then repeat the whole cycle again.
(Until the recording is over)

293
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:50,640
Because what it's looking for is a specific pattern to how you're moving

294
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,700
and then based off of that, measure out the proportion of your body.

295
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,100
So you gotta make sure you try not to screw it up.

296
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,000
So have a little rehearsal before you do this process.

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,790
Once it does the whole thing, it should give you a result.

298
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:06,410
Unfortunately, I am terrible with the numbers,

299
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,410
so I'm just gonna assume that they're correct.

300
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,610
And there you have it.

301
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:12,480
We got kind of a result that we may want.

302
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:15,530
You can see that I can kind of move my thigh like that

303
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,230
and I could probably stand on something

304
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,380
and you'd see that I'm standing on something.

305
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:21,030
So we're kind of all set.

306
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22,950
And that's pretty much it.

307
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,110
This is how you strap phones onto yourself to play VR.

308
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:29,160
Right, let's get on VRChat.

309
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,540
Right, now that we're in the world in VRChat,

310
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:35,080
what you want to do is we're going to click on "Calibrate FBT" [Full Body Tracking]

311
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:39,580
because the trackers are not linked to our avatar just yet.

312
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,930
So what you're going to do is stretch your arms.

313
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:45,460
Here's my other controller and you might want to look around

314
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:50,350
and make sure that your trackers are aligned to your avatar

315
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,290
and then click both triggers.

316
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,880
And now it's clicked in.

317
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:58,280
Now we can move around.

318
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:01,730
Although it's a little bit janky, it's not exactly perfect.

319
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:05,280
These are some things that you might want to set in the Slime VR settings

320
00:16:05,283 --> 00:16:08,510
to fine tune it so that it'll be almost perfect.

321
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:11,700
However, I don't really have all the time to set it up primarily

322
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,540
because this setup is not actually my real full body tracking setup.

323
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:18,430
I actually have a real full body tracking setup that is also Slime VR

324
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:23,110
but by concept, this is one of the funniest ideas I've ever made
(*"made for a vid")

325
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:26,310
that is technically possible by documentation officially

326
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:28,010
by Slime VR themselves.

327
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:31,360
So I'm basically just making a video so people know that,

328
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,890
hey, you can use your phones as trackers if you don't mind

329
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:37,960
the huge chunky phone on your ankle.

330
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:41,960
But yeah, I hope you like this fairly weird lackluster video

331
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:45,780
that somehow needs to take quite long to edit

332
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:48,410
and put out onto YouTube, I guess.

333
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:54,210
And oh, by the way, if you move the hip tracker, it works.

334
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:57,510
But yeah, with that said, I don't know what to tell you.

335
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,980
It's just one of the dumbest videos I have ever made in my life.

336
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:06,560
But I hope you enjoy this well outside phone tech kind of video

337
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:08,810

Donate me financially so that you can support me

344
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:26,280
and I'll be able to continue making this crazy videos like that

345
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:30,450
and hopefully, eventually, I might be able to hire an editor.

346
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,260
Who knows?

347
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:32,380
We'll never know for now.

348
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,450
But also check out my Discord

349
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,000
if you want to keep in touch with me

350
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,030
and have a good chat about anything tech.

351
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:39,560
You can also check out my live streams

352
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:41,060
because I'll be playing some games

353
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,290
and also have some chat yap-e-rinos.

354
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,960
This is where I basically have fun

355
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:48,530
and do content that I can't really do on video

356
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,660
because it's not really good for the algorithm.

357
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,260
So I do it on the live stream

358
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:54,450
because sometimes it's a lot more fun to do it

359
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,080
on the live stream than to do it on video.

360
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,930
But you know, you get the gist.

361
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,260
And with that said, thank you all so much for watching.

362
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:02,260
Oh god, this is such a stupid video.

363
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:03,560
There's so much things to clean up.

364
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,700
Not to mention the phones I've strapped onto myself.

365
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,130
I gotta take it all down and everything.

366
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,430
But yeah, see you guys next time.

It's so hot.

375
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,680
The phones are somewhat heating up.
