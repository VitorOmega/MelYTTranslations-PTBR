1
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:08,716
This is going to be an ASMR audio and I'll explain in a moment.

2
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:14,533
Kon-Melo, welcome to the single most riskiest video

3
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,433
that I have ever been wanting to produce.

4
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:22,649
So I'm gonna put on the screen below when I'm recording this today

5
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,766
and you'll see why it took me stupid long to release this video.

6
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:30,233
So a little backstory here, 

7
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:34,033
but without revealing too much personal information or

8
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:39,700
any parts of Mel's private life, the best way I can describe myself is

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,766
I got extremely lucky.

10
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:47,566
So I was able to not ever touch the donators' money on Ko-fi,

11
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,616
check out the links below, and purchase this one thing.

12
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:59,783
This right here, if you know by the dimensions and by the shape, you

13
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:00,966
would immediately know

14
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,200
what this is.

15
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,400
But in case you don't know what this is, I'm gonna open it up right now.

16
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,333
This fucking mic.

17
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,216
You're absolutely not mistaken, I got a Steam Deck.

18
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:35,299
So obviously, out of a Steam Deck,

19
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,133
I would expect the Steam Deck console itself

20
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:41,416
and the charger because I've watched way too many people unbox this shit.

21
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:44,549
So it has become really stupid obvious to me.

22
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,483
So let's get into the least impressive one, which is the charger.

23
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,066
Fuck.

24
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:00,883
It's got this partition thingymajig.

25
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:05,400
If you're wondering why I'm trying to not speak so loud,

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,266
that's primarily because this Steam Deck

27
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,966
 is a secret as of the time of recording.

28
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:13,016
By the time you see this video,

29
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:16,966
 I have pretty much integrated the Steam Deck into my life,

30
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:20,333
and no one would know that I bought this in a flash.

31
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:23,233
Now, if you've watched multiple streams of mine, 

32
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:26,333
I have constantly told you that I am Asian.

33
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,666
And I'm not shitting you...

34
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,866
But I still ended up with a European plug.

35
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,349
You know what, I guess I'll have to use an adapter for that.

36
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,099
But to be fair, I live in a country

37
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:43,000
that does not have a proper official seller for Steam Deck,

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,066
so obviously I had to import one from the EU.

39
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:47,983
Shoutout to European gang.

40
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,300
Gosh darn, there's a sticker.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,433
What the hell am I supposed to open this with?

42
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:57,016
For legal reasons, I can't whip up my utility knife,

43
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:59,333
so I got a pair of scissors instead.

44
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,550
(snip snip snip)

45
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,199
If you're wondering why I'm not peeling it off,

46
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,483
that's primarily because I'm wearing a fucking glove.

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,583
Fuck.

48
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:16,900
This is gonna be the most painful unboxing of a Steam Deck

49
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,683
 a creator has ever done.

50
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,383
Fuck...

51
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:25,816
Fucking hell.

52
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,400
Open it up!

53
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:31,083
Here, here, here, listen to this.

54
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,599
Oh, the sticker finally gave in.

55
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:37,383
Nice.

56
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,699
Please, I just wanna open.

57
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,000
Fuck it, gloves off.

58
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:43,533
I'm opening it up instead.

59
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:44,483
Damn it.

60
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,866
God, using scissors properly is a whole lot easier.

61
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,283
I'm sorry for rage baiting, guys.

62
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,066
All right.

63
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,533
What the hell?

64
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,666
Good day, mate.

65
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,483
Welcome to England.

66
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:21,283
Well, I guess I really do need an adapter for that.

67
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:22,000
Fuck.

68
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,916
All right, let's get the console out.

69
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:31,699
"To avoid danger of suffocation, 

70
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,100
keep this plastic bag away from the babies and children.

71
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,166
Do not use this bag in cribs, beds, carriages, or playpens.

72
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,683
This is not a toy."

73
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,100
I wonder where that warning came from.

74
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,883
Oh, they're stuck that way, huh?

75
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:56,166
Well, that's unique.

76
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,016
(Homelab server ramping up)

77
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,366
Can my Homelab server shut the fuck up.

78
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,116
It's so loud, what the fuck?

79
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:10,283
Okay, now what do I do?

80
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,033
I should probably slide this off.

81
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:15,316
Oh.

82
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,116
Oh.

83
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,483
Oh, it got stuck.

84
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,800
Oh, that's why.

85
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:22,399
Fuck.

86
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:26,600
Please.

87
00:05:27,683 --> 00:05:28,866
I beg you.

88
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,016
Door's stuck.

89
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:38,333
Here it is, the Steam Deck OLED.

90
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:41,683
Usually, when you watch from other creators,

91
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:43,300
they always show a top-down view,

92
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,283
making it look like this was printed on.

93
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:46,216
I kid you not.

94
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:48,316
It's a little elevated.

95
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,366
It's like it's stamped on or something.

96
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,699
It's kind of textured.

97
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,399
So, pretty cool, I guess.

98
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,166
I've seen a lot of people, 

99
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,816
when they first opened their Valve Steam Deck,

100
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:58,083
they never show the tag.

101
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,333
I don't know what's up with it.

102
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,483
Maybe Valve bans showing it or something.

103
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:02,466
I don't know.

104
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:05,133
But there's this security tag that proves that

105
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,516
this Valve Steam Deck has not been tampered with,

106
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,166
which is pretty fucking awesome.

107
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:12,533
You don't really see that a lot from other boxes or something.

108
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:14,733
Now begs the question, how do you open it?

109
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,066
Oh, it was that easy.

110
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,183
Security tag's off.

111
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:29,816
I should probably put the mic in front again.

112
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,766
("Aural bliss")

113
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:55,199
Oh.

114
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,266
It's the wrong way up.

115
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,016
Wow, would you look at that?

116
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,233
This feels surreal.

117
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:18,566
Oh, hello.

118
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,483
Hey, camera gang.

119
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,783
So, the volume buttons are here.

120
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,800
Headphone jack.

121
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:27,100
Type-C.

122
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:28,183
Power button.

123
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,916
We got the R1, L1.

124
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,516
Oh, the analogs feel...

125
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,600
really nice.

126
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,833
Really, really fucking nice.

127
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,566
So, I gotta be honest with you.

128
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,566
It pretty much feels like...

129
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,516
8BitDo controller when it comes to buttons.

130
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:18,466
So, I would say A for effort, Valve.

131
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,683
Right, let's boot it up.

132
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Oh.

133
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,733
I felt some vibration.

134
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,000
Woah.

135
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,916
Come on, camera, fucking focus, bruv.

136
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,016
Oh, satisfying.

137
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,016
Damn.

138
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,383
Pacific Standard Time.

139
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:55,183
Where the fuck am I, California?

140
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:56,516
You know what?

141
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,049
I guess I'll do the setup off-camera. But...

142
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:01,383
But there you have it.

143
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:05,483
That's pretty much the most I can show you at the moment.

144
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,933
Until I finally publish this video,

145
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,799
and then I'll make another video after that.

146
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,916
But nonetheless, thank you so, so, so much for watching.

147
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:15,683
And I hope you understand what took so long

148
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:17,149
to publish this very video.

149
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:21,750
And I guess I'm pretty much enjoying my Steam Deck, I guess.

150
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,366
If you got any questions about how the Steam Deck feels

151
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:25,666
or whatever that is,

152
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,666
let me know in the comments below.

153
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:28,766
And as always,

156

See ya.

157
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:34,033
Boom.
