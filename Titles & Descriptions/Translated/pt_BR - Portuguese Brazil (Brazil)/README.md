## Translation Guidelines (specifically for Brazilian Portuguese)
> Guidelines are placed to ensure the quality control 
> of subtitles are up to par for each translator.
> However, not every language has the same guidelines
> for the rules of translations.
> Thus, the guidelines here mainly focus on
> translation mentality rather than format.

#### Consistent tones and formalities
```
At times, I might get informal as heck. Try to match the tones you've
heard from medias like TV shows, movies or even VTuber conversations.
```

#### Do not keep localized names the way it is
```
My name in English will always be Melori Valentine. If you're unsure of the spelling of other MeloriTensei related specific namings, please refer to other (originally) English subs for reference.
```
